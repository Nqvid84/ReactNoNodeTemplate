# ReactNoNodeTemplate

**ReactNoNodeTemplate** is a versatile template for building React applications using Vite without requiring a local Node.js installation. This template simplifies the development process by integrating essential libraries and GitHub Actions for automatic builds and deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Features

- **No Node.js Required:** Start building your React applications without needing to install Node.js locally.
- **Automatic Builds:** Changes made in the repository trigger automatic builds.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment:** Easily deploy your application as a live GitHub Page.

## Getting Started

To get started with **ReactNoNodeTemplate**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nqvid84/ReactNoNodeTemplate.git
   cd ReactNoNodeTemplate
   ```

2. **Make Changes:**
   - Open the project in your favorite Git IDE.
   - Modify the files as needed.

3. **View Your Changes:**
   - Your changes will automatically trigger a build and be available on your GitHub Pages.

## Usage Example

While being in your cloned repository by pressing `period key (.)` in your keyboard navigate into `Git IDE` and after changing to desired state commit and wait for `Github Actions` to build and deploy your project.

there are some limitation in build time but realistically it's much more than we need for `Front-end` developing.

 - this project can be used within any IDE but the simplest way is to use the git itself, feel free to expand and use what you like.
